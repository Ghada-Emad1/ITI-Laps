when i practice. it is so funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the 
ball with her mouth.</font>

<p>once soha saved my life. when i was only 4years old.I started to go into the strest
to get a ball that had rolled across the street. of course i didnot think to look for cars. sosha got in
front of me and krecked me backward onto the sidewal, i was mad until i saw the car go by 
where i would have been
then i was so happy that sosha was smarter than i was
